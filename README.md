🧠 Mental Health Analysis
📘 Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of mental health data to better understand patterns, predictors, and trends associated with mental health conditions. The goal is to provide insights that can help in early detection, better policy design, and awareness-building around mental health issues.

🧾 Objectives
Analyze mental health survey data and related datasets

Identify key factors influencing mental well-being

Develop machine learning models to predict mental health risk

Visualize correlations and trends over demographics and time

📂 Contents
data/: Raw and processed mental health datasets

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and modeling

models/: Trained model files and evaluation metrics

scripts/: Python scripts for data processing and training

visualizations/: Charts and plots generated during analysis

README.md: Project documentation (you’re here!)

🧠 Datasets Used
Mental Health in Tech Survey (Kaggle/Oxford Data Lab)

WHO Mental Health Atlas

Depression and Anxiety Statistics by Country

Custom survey data (if applicable)

Note: Ensure all datasets comply with GDPR/ethical data usage standards.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python 3.x

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Scikit-learn

TensorFlow / PyTorch (optional)

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Analysis Performed
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Correlation and regression analysis

Clustering (e.g., K-Means)

Classification modeling (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression)

Sentiment analysis (if using text data)

🤖 Predictive Modeling
Built models to predict the likelihood of a mental health issue based on:

Age, gender, occupation

Family history

Work environment

Previous diagnosis and symptoms

📈 Key Findings (Example)
Higher likelihood of mental health issues among younger adults

Strong correlation between lack of workplace support and increased stress

Gender disparities in reporting and seeking help

⚖️ Ethical Considerations
Avoid bias in model predictions

Preserve user privacy and data anonymity

Focus on supporting, not stigmatizing, mental health
